There's still a lot to work on with this concept, such as:

- Adding support for other religious texts and nonreligious quotes using existing APIs
- Reminders to pray sent to users on pre-selected times of day.
- Sending daily scriptures, sayings, lessons directly to users through email
- Moral Chat where you can talk about the daily scripture and lessons. 
- Like/Save buttons on the verses you like best.
